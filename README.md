# High-Frequency-Variability-in-Wind-Speed

Analyzed high-frequency wind variability across 13+ Automated Weather Stations (AWS) in India, improving data
accuracy for climate studies.
• Processed and visualized wind speed data, uncovering key atmospheric trends relevant to monsoon forecasting.
• Presented findings to senior researchers, highlighting the scientific significance of weather prediction models.
Studied the first-of-its-kind high-frequency wind variability across diverse geographical regions of India.
• Generated and studied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plots from wind speed data for over 13 different AWS
stations across India for month-wise and season-wise data and tabulated the results.
• Presented significant findings of relevant phenomena with my mentor and other concerned scientists.
